### Probablisitic data structures
1. [Bloom Filter](https://d2.naver.com/helloworld/749531)
  - get approximate *membership of elements* in efficient time
  - false positive
2. [Count-Min Sketch](https://d2.naver.com/helloworld/799782)
  - get approximate *frequency of elements* in efficient memory
3. [HyperLogLog](https://d2.naver.com/helloworld/711301)
  - get approximate *cardinality of set* in efficient memory

1,2,3 -> need ***k*** independent hash functions
